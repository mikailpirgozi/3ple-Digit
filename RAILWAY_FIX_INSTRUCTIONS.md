# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Railway Database Fix Instructions

## Problem

Your Railway PostgreSQL database is not accessible. This is preventing login and backend functionality.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Check Railway Dashboard

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Open your "3ple digit app" project
3. Check if you have PostgreSQL service

### 2. If PostgreSQL is Missing

1. Click **"New Service"** â†’ **"PostgreSQL"**
2. Wait for provisioning (1-2 minutes)
3. Once created, click on the PostgreSQL service
4. Go to **"Variables"** tab
5. Copy the `DATABASE_URL`

### 3. Update Backend Service

1. Click on your **backend** service
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Update or add `DATABASE_URL` with the new value from PostgreSQL
4. The backend will auto-redeploy

### 4. Initialize Database

Once backend is deployed with new database:

```bash
# From your local machine
cd apps/api

# Update local .env with new DATABASE_URL
nano .env  # paste new DATABASE_URL

# Push schema to new database
npx prisma db push

# Create admin user
npm run seed
```

### 5. Verify

- Backend should be accessible at: https://[your-backend-url].up.railway.app/api/health
- You should be able to login with seeded credentials

## Alternative: If PostgreSQL Exists but is Down

1. Click on PostgreSQL service
2. Check the logs for errors
3. Try **"Restart"** from the service menu
4. If that fails, you may need to create a new PostgreSQL service

## Important URLs to Check

- Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Your Project: Look for "3ple digit app"
- Backend Logs: Click backend service â†’ "Logs" tab
- Database Status: Click PostgreSQL service â†’ "Metrics" tab

## Need Help?

If the database was deleted or lost:

1. Create new PostgreSQL service
2. Update DATABASE_URL everywhere
3. Re-run migrations
4. Re-seed data

The good news: Your code is fine, it's just a database connection issue!
